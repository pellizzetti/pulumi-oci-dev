/**
 * This data source provides the list of Cross Connect Port Speed Shapes in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
 *
 * Lists the available port speeds for cross-connects. You need this information
 * so you can specify your desired port speed (that is, shape) when you create a
 * cross-connect.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testCrossConnectPortSpeedShapes = oci.core.getCrossConnectPortSpeedShapes({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 * });
 * ```
