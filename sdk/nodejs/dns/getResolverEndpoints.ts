/**
 * This data source provides the list of Resolver Endpoints in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS service.
 *
 * Gets a list of all endpoints within a resolver. The collection can be filtered by name or lifecycle state.
 * It can be sorted on creation time or name both in ASC or DESC order. Note that when no lifecycleState
 * query parameter is provided, the collection does not include resolver endpoints in the DELETED
 * lifecycle state to be consistent with other operations of the API. Requires a `PRIVATE` scope query parameter.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testResolverEndpoints = oci.dns.getResolverEndpoints({
 *     resolverId: oci_dns_resolver.test_resolver.id,
 *     scope: "PRIVATE",
 *     name: _var.resolver_endpoint_name,
 *     state: _var.resolver_endpoint_state,
 * });
 * ```
